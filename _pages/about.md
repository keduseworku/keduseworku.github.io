I’m Keduse, a third year astrophysics PhD student at Johns Hopkins University advised by Marc Kamiokowski. I’m interested in the intersections of theoretical and observational cosmology. Our recent work probed late-time signatures of relic neutrinos in the non-linear regime. I am also wrapping up another project in JWST observations of gravitationally lensed galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization with Dr. Dan Coe at STScI. Next, I will be focusing on imprints of early universe physics on 21cm observables. 

Before graduate school, I was a Postbaccalaureate researcher within the Princeton Physics Department working with Professor Jo Dunkley on CMB cross correlations with ACT maps in order to improve foreground constraints. I completed my B.S. in Astrophysics at Yale University working in a different subfield, exoplanets, with Professors Greg Laughlin and Songhu Wang.
