I’m Keduse, a third year astrophysics PhD student at Johns Hopkins University advised by [Marc Kamionkowski](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kamionkowski/). I’m interested in the intersections of theoretical and observational cosmology. Our recent work probed late-time signatures of relic neutrinos in the non-linear regime through our JAX code [Cheetah](https://github.com/NNSSA/Cheetah/tree/main). I’m also wrapping up another project with JWST observations of gravitationally lensed galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization with [Dr. Dan Coe](https://www.dancoe.space/) at STScI. I’ve recently started focusing on imprints of early universe physics on 21cm observables. 

Before graduate school, I was a Postbaccalaureate researcher within the Princeton Physics Department working with Professor [Jo Dunkley](https://www.jodunkley.com/) on CMB cross correlations with ACT maps in order to improve foreground constraints. I completed my B.S. in Astrophysics at Yale University working in a different subfield, exoplanets, with Professors Greg Laughlin and Songhu Wang, and I had summer cosmology and galaxy formation projects at Flatiron CCA and The Center for Astrophysics - Harvard & Smithsonian.
